# DLC Specification — Deep Linguistic Core (v1.0)

The Deep Linguistic Core (DLC) is the semantic substrate beneath LOS.  
Where LOS governs structure, routing, and alignment, DLC governs **meaning itself**.

DLC defines the stable, typed, representational layer that ensures SynCE reasoning is semantically coherent, persistent, and invariant across states.

DLC operates at **Runtime Layer L0 (alongside LOS)** and provides the semantic primitives used by:

- Semantic Tokens (L1)
- SCP (L2)
- ORCH-C (L3)
- Cognitive Governance (L4)
- SynCE Runtime (L5)

---

## 1. Purpose

DLC exists to ensure:

- stable, typed semantic meaning  
- deep continuity of interpretation  
- representational invariants  
- grounded internal state  
- propagation of meaning between steps  
- semantic alignment across layers  

DLC provides the *deep semantic rules* that keep the SynCE engine coherent.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Typed Semantic Spaces
DLC defines the stable semantic “geometry” used by LOS and higher layers:

- conceptual domains  
- representational invariants  
- semantic anchors (persistent meaning nodes)  
- relational frames (how concepts relate)  

Typed semantic spaces guarantee that meaning remains consistent even when surface-level language shifts.

### 2.2 Grounded Internal State
DLC maintains the deep internal reasoning state:

- latent conceptual structures  
- semantic embeddings normalized into stable frames  
- carrier-context for long-range meaning  
- invariant meaning structure across steps  

### 2.3 Semantic Propagation
DLC ensures meaning flows correctly between layers:

- upward: meaning → LOS → ST → SCP → ORCH-C  
- downward: constraints → posture influence → representational alignment  

This preserves continuity over multi-step reasoning sequences.

## 3. DLC Architecture (GitHub-Safe Diagram)

```text
DLC Architecture — High-Level

+-----------------------------+
| Typed Semantic Spaces       |
|  • conceptual domains       |
|  • stable invariants        |
+-----------------------------+
| Grounded Internal State     |
|  • persistent frames        |
|  • continuity anchors       |
+-----------------------------+
| Deep Meaning Propagation    |
|  • long-range inheritance   |
|  • step-to-step coherence   |
+-----------------------------+

DLC underpins all LOS structures and provides deep,
stable meaning for the entire SynCE engine.

## 4. DLC Responsibilities in the SynCE Stack

### How Higher Layers Use DLC

**Semantic Tokens (L1)**  
- normalizes meaning frames using DLC semantic rules

**SCP (L2)**  
- declarative control constraints reference DLC’s typed meaning spaces

**ORCH-C (L3)**  
- planning + routing rely on stable DLC meaning structures

**Cognitive Governance (L4)**  
- CRI / ATC / SSR coherence checks depend on DLC invariants

**SynCE Runtime (L5)**  
- all runtime reasoning modes require DLC to maintain semantic consistency

DLC is the **semantic substrate** that ensures all higher layers behave predictably.

## 5. DLC Public-Stable API (v1.0)

These describe logical interfaces, not code.

### 5.1 MeaningFrame Normalization
- convert raw meaning → stable DLC frames  
- enforce representational invariants  
- resolve deep meaning ambiguities  

### 5.2 Concept/Relation Anchoring
- attach tokens to stable meaning anchors  
- maintain long-range semantic continuity  
- enforce invariants across steps  

### 5.3 Semantic Propagation
- propagate meaning frames upward to LOS  
- merge meaning with new context  
- perform continuity alignment  

### 5.4 Invariant Enforcement
- lock semantic identity  
- verify representational equivalence  
- ensure structural coherence
